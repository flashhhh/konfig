## Description
This is the collection of my configuration files for the set of my preferred applications. I've created this repository to track the history of them and as a backup.

## Local usage
To use these configuration files locally, I keep this repository at my ~/konfig and I use symbolic links to proper directories and files at ~/.bashrc, ~/.vim/, ~/.vimrc, etc.

## Remote usage
TODO
